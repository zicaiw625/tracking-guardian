# Privacy & Consent Configuration (P0-03)
# 
# DESIGN PRINCIPLE: Declare accurately what the pixel does
# ============================================================================
# 
# This pixel sends checkout_completed events to our backend, which then
# forwards conversion data to advertising platforms (Meta CAPI, TikTok Events API, etc.)
# This constitutes both analytics AND marketing use, as well as data sharing.
#
# CONSENT REQUIREMENTS:
# - analytics=true: Required for conversion measurement functionality
# - marketing=true: Required because we send data to ad platforms for attribution
# - sale_of_data="enabled": We share conversion data with third parties (ad platforms)
#
# HOW SHOPIFY'S CONSENT GATING WORKS:
# ============================================================================
# IMPORTANT: Shopify ONLY loads this pixel when ALL declared purposes are satisfied.
# This is NOT just analytics+marketing, it includes ALL declared requirements:
#   1. analytics consent granted (if analytics=true)
#   2. marketing consent granted (if marketing=true)
#   3. preferences consent granted (if preferences=true) - not used by this pixel
#   4. sale_of_data NOT opted-out (if sale_of_data="enabled")
# 
# If ANY of the above conditions is not met, Shopify will NOT load this pixel at all.
# This means:
#   - If customer denies marketing consent → pixel will NOT load
#   - If customer opts out of sale_of_data (CCPA) → pixel will NOT load
#   - Our code still checks saleOfDataAllowed as defense-in-depth
#
# SALE_OF_DATA OPTIONS:
# ============================================================================
# - "enabled": Pixel requires sale_of_data consent. If customer opts out (CCPA),
#              Shopify will NOT load the pixel at all. (CURRENT CHOICE)
# - "ldu": Limited Data Use mode. Pixel loads even if customer opts out, but
#          we must implement LDU logic (send only non-identifying data to ad platforms).
#          Choose this if you want to send restricted signals even after opt-out.
# - "disabled": We don't share data with third parties (not applicable for CAPI apps).
#
# This is the most compliant configuration for App Store review, ensuring:
# - Privacy disclosure in Partner Dashboard matches actual behavior
# - Customers must explicitly consent to marketing before any data is shared
# - CCPA sale_of_data opt-out is fully respected (pixel doesn't load)
#
[customer_privacy]
  # Analytics: required for conversion tracking measurement
  analytics = true
  # Marketing: required because we share data with ad platforms (Meta, TikTok, etc.)
  # This ensures pixel only loads when user explicitly consents to marketing
  marketing = true
  # Preferences: not used by this pixel
  preferences = false
  # Sale of data: enabled - we share conversion data with third-party ad platforms
  # When user opts out (CCPA), our code respects that and doesn't send data
  sale_of_data = "enabled"

# P0-01: Ingestion Key configuration
# Backend URL is hardcoded in the pixel code for security (no merchant override allowed).
# This prevents any possibility of data exfiltration to unauthorized endpoints.

[settings]
  # Ingestion Key - store-scoped key for request correlation and noise filtering
  # 
  # SECURITY CLARIFICATION:
  # - This is a WEAK validation mechanism, NOT a security boundary
  # - The key is visible in browser network traffic (not truly secret)
  # - Primary purpose: correlate pixel events with webhooks, filter noise/misconfiguration
  # - Defense layers are server-side: Origin validation, rate limiting, order ownership
  #
  # Server behavior:
  # - Missing/invalid key: request rejected (204 No Content)
  # - Valid key: request processed (correlated with shop for diagnostics)

  # Note: debug field removed - Shopify settings are always strings (single_line_text_field)
  # and parsing boolean strings correctly across create/update/read cycles is error-prone.
  # For debugging, developers can use browser DevTools to inspect network requests.
